# About
This project is a web application built for SOEN 341 during the Winter 2025 term.

The goal is to create a versatile communication platform, dubbed "ChatHaven", in which users may freely send messaages through text channels or direct messaging.

# Main Features.

1. Text Channels for Group Communication: Users can join a set of channels (e.g., "General," "Project Help," "Social"), all messages sent in a channel are visible to all users in that channel.
2. Direct Messaging Between Users (DM): Users can message other users directly. Conversations using DM can only be seen by people involved in the DM.
3. Role-Based User Permissions: Split between two roles - Admin or Member. Admins can create/delete channels and moderate messages (delete inappropriate ones), while members can only send and view messages.
4. More features to come.
